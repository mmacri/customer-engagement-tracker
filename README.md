Customer Engagement Tracker – README

📌 Overview

Welcome to the Customer Engagement Tracker—a powerful, AI-driven framework designed for Technical Account Managers (TAMs) and Customer Success Specialists (CSS) to streamline customer engagement, optimize adoption, mitigate risks, and drive business value.

This GitHub repository houses the core files and documentation related to the Customer Engagement Tracker demo, as showcased on the interactive site.

🚀 What This Tracker Does

The Customer Engagement Tracker is built to help TAMs and CSS teams:
	•	Prioritize customer interactions based on business impact, renewal risk, and adoption urgency.
	•	Automate Quarterly Business Reviews (QBRs) by generating reports that summarize adoption trends, ROI, and engagement plans.
	•	Predict customer retention risks using AI-powered modeling.
	•	Identify expansion opportunities by mapping customer maturity against cross-sell/upsell potential.
	•	Provide AI-driven recommendations for next best actions (NBA) to drive engagement.

The system includes two versions:
	•	🔹 Internal Version (For TAMs & Sales Teams) → Includes revenue impact, expansion pipeline, risk analysis, and competitor insights.
	•	🔹 Customer-Facing Version → Focuses on success milestones, adoption progress, and business value realization.

📖 How to Use the Customer Engagement Tracker

1️⃣ Step 1: Enter Customer Details
	•	Start by adding customer information, including:
	•	Company Name, Industry, ARR, Key Stakeholders.
	•	Subscription Plan, Renewal Date, Expansion Potential.
	•	Current Tech Stack (for competitive analysis).

2️⃣ Step 2: Engagement Prioritization & Risk Assessment
	•	The AI-driven prioritization model categorizes customers based on:
	•	Engagement Priority Score → Calculated from ARR, renewal status, adoption, and risk factors.
	•	Churn Risk vs. Expansion Potential Matrix → AI classifies accounts into:
	•	🚨 High Risk – High Value → Immediate intervention required.
	•	💡 High Value – Low Risk → Strategic upsell opportunity.
	•	⚠️ Low Adoption – High ARR → Adoption workshop needed.

3️⃣ Step 3: Generate Quarterly Business Review (QBR)
	•	One-click QBR generation:
	•	Summarizes key adoption trends, ROI impact, and engagement recommendations.
	•	Auto-fills presentation slides with customer-specific data.
	•	Generates AI-recommended talking points for customer conversations.

4️⃣ Step 4: Track Ongoing Progress & Optimize Engagement
	•	Use the Predictive Success Dashboard to monitor:
	•	Feature adoption rates and usage patterns.
	•	Risk indicators and churn likelihood.
	•	Customer sentiment (NPS, survey data).
	•	Get AI-driven recommendations on next steps, such as:
	•	Scheduling executive alignment meetings.
	•	Assigning a product specialist to drive feature adoption.
	•	Planning contract expansion discussions.
